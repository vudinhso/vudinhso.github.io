Welcome. My first name is Dinh-Son. I am a lecturer in Robotics and Mechatronics at [RMIT Vietnam](https://www.rmit.edu.vn/). 
You will find information about my research interests, my teaching phylosophy, and other types of projects. 
I obtained my Engineering degree in France from the [University of Technology of Compiegne (UTC)](https://www.utc.fr/en/) and majored in mechatronics (MARS) in 2010.  
My MSc in [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/) (2011) focused on autonomous vehicle dynamics and control (AVDC).
I pursued a PhD in robotics at [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/en) (2017) on a mechanical system for lower limb rehabilitation. 
My postdoctoral experience in [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/) (2019) dealt with the development of upper limb exoskeleton for the elderly population. 
From 2019 to 2022, I had a position at the American University of the Middle East (Kuwait) where I developed courses related to mechatronics and fundamentals of mechanical engineering. 
Please contact me by [email](dinh-son.vu@rmit.edu.vn) if our research interests are aligned. 

Teaching's philosophy
======
Here you can put a little bit about yourself and your style of teaching. Having some literature references would be appreciated as well. 
You like to work with students like sharing your passion. More people interested means also that more people to interact and play with. 
You can also add a link to your former university [Ulaval](https://robot.gmc.ulaval.ca/accueil/?no_cache=1)

Research areas
======
You can create a list like this: 
1. Parallel mechanisms
1. Human Robot Interaction
1. Kinematics
1. Cable-based mechanisms
1. Exoskeletons
1. Swarm robotics and drones
