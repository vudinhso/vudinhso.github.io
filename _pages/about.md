Welcome. My first name is Dinh-Son. I am a lecturer in Robotics and Mechatronics at [RMIT Vietnam](https://www.rmit.edu.vn/). 
You will find information about my research interests, my teaching phylosophy, and other types of projects. 

I obtained my Engineering degree in France from the University of Technology of Compiegne and majored in mechatronics (MARS) in 2010. My MSc at Cranfield University in 2011 focused on autonomous vehicle dynamics and control (AVDC). I pursued a PhD in robotics at Laval University (2012-2017) on a mechanical system for lower limb rehabilitation. My postdoctoral experience at Aalborg University (2017-2019) dealt with the development of upper limb exoskeleton for the elderly population. 
From 2019 to 2022, I had a position at the American University of the Middle East where I developed courses related to mechatronics and fundamentals of mechanical engineering.

Please contact me by email if our research interests are aligned. 

Teaching's philosophy
======
Since middle school, explaining lectures and exercises to other students in the classroom has been a technique to learn more effectively and to develop my technical vocabulary and improve my speech. In higher education, learning complex topics such as kinematics, multi-body dynamics, and robotics is a challenge that brought me a lot of joy and delight, but can be intimidating. Raising passion and looking forward to new horizons in robotics, artificial intelligence, and their impacts in our society are keys to design a nuturing classrom of active future collaborators. 

1. Teaching confirms your understanding of the topics. 
1. It raises future collaborators with high ethics and dedication. 
1. Younger minds have almost limitless ambition and this is inspiring. 
1. Just like sport and entertainment, sharing and discussing about robotics, solving its equations, and finding state-of-the-art applications can be endless. 

Research areas
======
My topics of interests are: 
1. Parallel mechanisms
1. Physical Human Robot Interaction
1. Kinematics
1. Cable-based mechanisms
1. Exoskeletons
1. Swarm robotics and drones
