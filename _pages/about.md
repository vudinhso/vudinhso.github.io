Welcome. My first name is Dinh-Son. I am a lecturer in Robotics and Mechatronics at [RMIT Vietnam](https://www.rmit.edu.vn/). 
You will find information about my research interests, my teaching phylosophy, and other types of projects. 

I obtained my Engineering degree in France from the University of Technology of Compiegne and majored in mechatronics (MARS) in 2010.  
My MSc at Cranfield University in 2011 focused on autonomous vehicle dynamics and control (AVDC).
I pursued a PhD in robotics at Laval University (2012-2017) on a mechanical system for lower limb rehabilitation. 
My postdoctoral experience at Aalborg University (2017-2019) dealt with the development of upper limb exoskeleton for the elderly population. 
From 2019 to 2022, I had a position at the American University of the Middle East where I developed courses related to mechatronics and fundamentals of mechanical engineering.

Please contact me by email if our research interests are aligned. 

Teaching's philosophy
======
I like teaching. 
1. It is a way to ensure that you are understanding what you are saying in a clear way. 
1. It is a way to find future collaborators. 
1. The dynamics of younger students and their limitless aspiration are inspiring. 
1. It is easy to share and enjoy topics that you are passionate about. 

Research areas
======
You can create a list like this:
